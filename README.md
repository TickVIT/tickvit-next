## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

If a student faces any issues they currently email numerous faculties, unsure which faculty is the right person to contact. This leads to further spam in the email's of the faculty and also delayed problem resolution.
 
## PROPOSED SOLUTION 

An online web-application based Help Ticket System. A student can create a ticket and with automatic problem categorization, it only reaches the faculty concerned with the student in-loop about the status of their tickets. 

The application is aimed to be cloud-based to allow only those with a valid account to create a ticket. Example: xyz@vitbhopal.ac.in 

There are numerous features we have planned that benefits to not just the students but also the faculty.
